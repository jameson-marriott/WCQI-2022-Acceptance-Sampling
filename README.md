# WCQI-2022-Acceptance-Sampling

This repository houses the shiny code for a Acceptance Sampling simulation created especially for the 2022 World Conference on Quality and Improvement.

The easiest way to run the app is to go to the version hosted by [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) at <https://jameson-marriott.shinyapps.io/WCQI-2022>.

If you are interested in viewing the code, it is in the app.R file you see on the homepage of the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/jameson-marriott/WCQI-2022-Acceptance-Sampling).

You can also run the app locally on your computer by [installing R and RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download), downloading and opening the app.R file in RStudio, and then clicking the "Run App" icon in the top right of the code editor window.
